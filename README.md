# Bootstrap5HTMLResume

A resume template done purely with HTML and CSS, which can be rendered into PDF through web browsers' print-to-PDF functionality, making a nice, sleek, professsional and ready-to-print resume. 

# Fonts, Icon Fonts, and Dependencies
* Font- Poppins [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins)
* Icons from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/)

# Paper Size/Orientation
* Currently letter portrait only - A4!

# Actually Rendering the PDF
* I've only tried on Chrome, on Windows.
* Just open the HTML file with the browser. No need to serve the document from any kind of web server --- the ``file:///`` protocol should be good enough.
* On Google Chrome:
  * Set **Margin** to **Default**.
  * Set **Scale** to **Default**.
  * Print **Background Graphics**.
  * Don't print headers and footers.
  * Save as PDF.
